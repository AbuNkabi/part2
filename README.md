In Part 1 of my assignment, I developed a Word proposal focusing on Pep Stores. The proposal was structured in a professional format, and I created a hierarchy to illustrate the organization of the included pages. This hierarchy provided a clear outline of the document’s sections and demonstrated the logical flow of information within the proposal. I also included images for visuals and better advertisment of the company outlining their services and how they can grow as a company

for Part 2 of my assignment , I worked on fixing the errors of part 1 as well as creating a code where by users are able to open the links of my page on a Laptop/Desktop ,tablet and/or a Smartphone . Worked with CSS styling to enhance the application . The changes I made now enables improned user experience and ensures accesibility for the wide ramge of devices
